## Issues
If something is crashing and you believe my mod may be at fault, Post it! Even if you are unsure!
When posting issues please do the following
- Include the Minecraft Version
- Crash reports must be posted in a pastebin (https://pastebin.com/), For security and for simplicity reasons.
- Do not add files to the post, Like text documents or world files. These will not help me at all and I will not download the for security reasons.
- Give detail on what you were doing at the time, Did you right-click? Did you put it in something else?
- Provide my mods version, Like "betabuild_4.2"
- Provide the forge version.
- Provide versions on other mods that could have also caused the problem

All of this infomation helps me to fix the problems faster

## Suggestions
Suggestions to my mod are sort of a hit and miss, I dont like request based on adding items or blocks. But will accept requests to possably change
how something works, Add extra configs, Support for other mods and such.
