# Issues
For anyone who bothers reading these. Here are some key things about posting issues.
1. USE PASTEBIN PLEASE! I will not download random files off someone I dont know.
2. Be descriptive about what happend with the crash, This includes what you were doing at the time and/or a mods list. The more infomation I get the better.
3. Be nice... :)
